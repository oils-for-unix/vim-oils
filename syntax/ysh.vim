" Vim syntax file
" Language: YSH
"
" Claude AI helped a lot here, because vim config confuses me
" But I've kept this initial version very bare-bones.  We can iterate on it.
"
" Larger version, with a few issues: https://github.com/sj2tpgk/vim-oil
"
" I put this in ~/.vim/syntax/ysh.vim
"
" And added this to my ~/.vimrc:
"
" augroup filetypedetect
"  au BufNewFile,BufRead *.ysh setf ysh
" augroup END

if exists("b:current_syntax")
  finish
endif

" This avoids problems with long multiline strings
:syntax sync minlines=200

" End-of-line comments
syn match yshComment "#.*$"

" TODO:
" - J8-style strings b'\n'
" - raw prefix r''
" - rarely used: $"" prefix
"   - also leaving out bash-style $'\n' strings
" - backslash escapes within strings:
"    - \" \$ in double quotes
"    - \u{123456} in J8-style strings
"
" - Is there way to understand recursion like ${a:-'foo'}?  Or just leave that
"   out
" - There is also recursiong of $(hostname) and such.
"
" - Here docs?  They are hard, could leave them out of YSH

" Single-quoted string
