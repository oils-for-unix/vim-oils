Vim Syntax Highlighting for Oils
====

Right now we're doing YSH only, not OSH.

## Installation

I use [vim-plug][], which is configured in your `~/.vimrc` like this:

    call plug#begin()
    
    Plug 'https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils.vim'
    
    call plug#end()

[vim-plug]: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

## Links


Here's an alternative plugin supports more features:

- <https://github.com/sj2tpgk/vim-oil>

Though I found an issue where it incorrectly highlighted single quotes within
`#` comments.

So I am trying something simpler.
